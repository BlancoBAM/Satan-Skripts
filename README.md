# Satan-Skripts
Work in progress, (obviously) but this I have recently started to induct my bestie/soul-sucking-throat-goated-succubae into the wonderful world of Linux, pen-testing, pirating, carding, E-Whoring and sleepless night after night with dry and painful eyes due to days at a time in bed on our seperate or shared PC's of world domination....Occasionally, that includes me hurrying to bang out a quick and dirty [ ;) ] script or two so that she can get used to the finer points on bash-ing, feel more comfortable with a CLI, fine tune her skills, practice, etc. etc. (but fr, I can get back to what Im doing and she can play with whatever she wants to play with quicker and with much less bitching and config') 


  Set to public so she can clone it, but if anyone else (who isnt already a follower/stargazer and therefore familiar with my eccentricities) should stumble upon this, don't bother trying to make sense of it, but its FOSS. Either way, Im adding shit as I go and it comes up organically so it may have one script a year, or 10,000. Its for K-Dub my love, not you "nerds" as she would drunkenly call you all, and myself as well.

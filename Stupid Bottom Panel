To change the bottom panel color in Kubuntu, you'll need to adjust the "Plasma Style" and potentially the color scheme or theme. You can achieve this by navigating to System Settings, then Appearance, and then either selecting a different Global Theme or customizing the existing one. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:

    1. Open System Settings:
    . 

Click on the K menu (or your equivalent application launcher) and search for "System Settings".
2. Navigate to Appearance:
.
In System Settings, find and click on "Appearance".
3. Choose a Global Theme:
.
Within the Appearance section, click on "Global Theme". Here, you can select a pre-defined theme or download new ones. 
4. Customize Existing Theme (Optional):
.
If you want to modify the current theme, you can click on "Plasma Style" (within the Appearance settings) and choose a different style like "Breeze Light" for a lighter panel, or explore more options. 
5. Adjust Colors:
.
If you need more specific color adjustments, you can find the "Colors" section (often under Appearance or Personalization) and adjust the color scheme to your liking. 
6. Apply Changes:
.
After making your selections, click "Apply" to save the changes. You may need to restart your session or the panel for the changes to take full effect. 

Additional Tips:

    If you're using a dark theme, you might need to adjust the "contrast" and "intensity" settings for the panel to be visible. 

For more advanced customization, you can edit the theme's configuration files di
